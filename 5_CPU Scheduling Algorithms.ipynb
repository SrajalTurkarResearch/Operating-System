    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "CPU scheduling decides which process runs on the CPU and when, optimizing performance in an operating system. Think of a chef in a kitchen (CPU) handling multiple orders (processes). The goal is to minimize waiting time, maximize CPU use, and prioritize critical tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Metrics**:\n",
    "- **Waiting Time**: Time a process waits in the ready queue.\n",
    "- **Turnaround Time**: Total time from submission to completion (waiting + burst time).\n",
    "- **Throughput**: Number of processes completed per unit time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why It Matters for Scientists**:\n",
    "- Optimizes computational tasks in simulations (e.g., physics, AI).\n",
    "- Critical for real-time systems (e.g., robotics, medical devices).\n",
    "- Foundation for designing efficient algorithms in research.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Example**: In a hospital, patient treatment scheduling prioritizes emergencies, similar to CPU scheduling prioritizing critical processes."

    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "**FCFS** is the simplest scheduling algorithm: processes are executed in the order they arrive. It’s like a queue at a ticket counter—first in, first served.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works**:\n",
    "- Processes are placed in a ready queue in arrival order.\n",
    "- The CPU executes each process to completion (non-preemptive).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Math**:\n",
    "- Waiting Time ($WT_i$): Sum of burst times of all previous processes.\n",
    "- Turnaround Time ($TAT_i$): $WT_i + BT_i$ (Burst Time).\n",
    "- Average Waiting Time: $\\frac{\\sum WT_i}{n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**: Simple, fair for early arrivals.\n",
    "**Cons**: Long waiting times if a process has a large burst time (**convoy effect**).\n",
    "\n",

    "### Context Switching Overhead\n",
    "- **Theory**: Switching between processes incurs overhead (saving/restoring state). High in RR with small quantum.\n",
    "- **Math**: Overhead $O$ per switch, total overhead = $O \\times \\text{number of switches}$.\n",
    "- **Application**: Minimize context switches in real-time systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Starvation and Aging\n",
    "- **Theory**: Low-priority processes may never run. Aging increases priority over time.\n",
    "- **Example**: In Priority Scheduling, a process waiting 10 seconds might gain +1 priority.\n",
    "- **Application**: Critical for fair scheduling in cloud systems.\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Theory**: Ensures tasks meet deadlines (e.g., Rate Monotonic, EDF).\n",
    "- **Relevance**: Vital for robotics, autonomous vehicles.\n",

    "### Queuing Theory\n",
    "- **Theory**: Models process waiting times using queues (e.g., M/M/1 model).\n",
    "- **Math**: Average waiting time in queue: $W_q = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu(\\mu - \\lambda)}$, where $\\lambda$ is arrival rate, $\\mu$ is service rate.\n",
