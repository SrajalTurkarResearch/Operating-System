    "### 1.1 Operating System Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "An **Operating System (OS)** is the software that manages a computer’s hardware and programs. Think of it as a restaurant manager coordinating chefs (CPU), tables (memory), and waiters (I/O devices) to serve customers (programs) efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Components**:\n",
    "  - **CPU**: The brain, processing billions of instructions per second (nanoseconds).\n",
    "  - **Memory (RAM)**: Fast storage for active data, erased on shutdown.\n",
    "  - **I/O Devices**: Slow devices (milliseconds) like disks, keyboards, and networks.\n",
    "  - **Kernel**: The OS core, controlling all hardware access.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy**: The OS is like a school principal assigning classrooms (memory), scheduling lessons (CPU), and managing doors (I/O) for students.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Example**: In a smartphone, the OS (Android/iOS) ensures apps like games and email share the CPU and memory without crashing, while handling touch inputs (I/O).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualization** (Draw this):\n",
    "```\n",
    "[User Programs: Game, Email]\n",
    "   --> [OS Kernel: Manager]\n",
    "         --> [CPU (Fast)] [Memory (Quick)] [I/O Devices (Slow: Disk, Network)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Arrows show command flow. Label CPU as “Nanoseconds” and I/O as “Milliseconds.”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practice Question**: List three tasks the OS does when you open a web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 I/O Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "**I/O (Input/Output)** is how data moves between a computer’s internal parts (CPU, memory) and external devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Types**:\n",
    "  - **Block I/O**: Large chunks (e.g., 4KB) from disks/SSDs.\n",
    "  - **Character I/O**: Streams of data (e.g., keyboard typing).\n",
    "  - **Network I/O**: Data over the internet (e.g., web pages).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Process**:\n",
    "  1. Program requests I/O (e.g., read file).\n",
    "  2. OS uses device drivers to talk to hardware.\n",
    "  3. Data moves: input to memory, output from memory.\n",
    "  4. CPU waits (blocking) or works on other tasks (non-blocking).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy**: I/O is like mailing a letter. You write fast (CPU), but the truck (device) is slow. The OS (post office) organizes delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Example**: In a hospital, I/O loads X-ray images (block I/O) from storage to show doctors quickly.\n",

    "\n",
    "I/O is slow compared to CPU/memory, causing delays (latency) and limiting work done (throughput). Optimization reduces waits and boosts efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Goals**:\n",
    "  - Lower latency (wait time).\n",
    "  - Higher throughput (tasks per second).\n",

    "  - Energy efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Math**:\n",
    "- Throughput = Tasks / Time.\n",
    "- Average Response Time (ART) = Σ(End Time - Start Time) / Tasks.\n",
    "- Example: Tasks take 2s, 3s, 5s. ART = (2+3+5)/3 = 3.33s.\n",
