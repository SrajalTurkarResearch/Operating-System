    "## Section 1: Foundations of Formal Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 What is Formal Modeling?\n",
    "Formal modeling uses mathematical structures to describe systems precisely, eliminating ambiguity. For OS, it models behaviors like process scheduling, inter-process communication (IPC), and resource allocation. Unlike informal descriptions (“the OS runs tasks”), formal models enable proofs of correctness (no crashes), safety (no illegal states), and liveness (tasks complete).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy**: An OS is like an airport. Informal: “Planes take off.” Formal: States (Taxiing, Airborne), transitions (Clearance), and proofs (no collisions). This precision is vital for reliable OS in phones, servers, or spacecraft.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Historical Context**: Formal methods emerged in the 1960s with Edsger Dijkstra’s work on program correctness. The seL4 microkernel’s verification in 2009 proved an OS could be bug-free for critical applications, a milestone in systems research.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Mindset**: Formal modeling is your hypothesis-testing tool. Ask: “Can I prove this OS avoids deadlocks?”\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Why State Machines and Process Algebras?\n",
    "- **State Machines**: Model sequential behavior (e.g., a process’s lifecycle). Visual and intuitive for beginners.\n",
    "- **Process Algebras**: Model concurrency and communication (e.g., processes sharing data). Abstract and scalable for complex systems.\n",
    "- **Combined**: Cover all OS aspects—sequential control and parallel interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Example**: Linux’s scheduler uses state-like concepts to manage tasks. Formal models detect race conditions, published in journals like *ACM Transactions on Computer Systems*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visual Aid**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Informal: 'OS schedules tasks' → Vague\n",
    "Formal: States (Running, Waiting), Transitions (Schedule) → Provable\n",
    "Goal: Verify no crashes or deadlocks\n",
