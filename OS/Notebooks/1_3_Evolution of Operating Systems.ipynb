        "- **Definition**: An OS is software that manages computer hardware (CPU, memory, storage) and software (applications), enabling user interaction.\n",
        "- **Analogy**: Think of a computer as a bustling city. Hardware (roads, utilities) is the infrastructure, applications (businesses) are services, and the OS is the mayor, coordinating everything to run smoothly.\n",
        "- **Real-World Example**: Your smartphone’s Android (Linux-based) or iOS (UNIX-based) OS lets you open apps, browse, and connect to Wi-Fi without managing the underlying chips.\n",
        "- **Why It Matters**: Without an OS, you’d write low-level code for every hardware task (e.g., reading a key press), slowing scientific work.\n",
        "- **Visualization**: Sketch three layers: Hardware (CPU, RAM), OS (middle), Applications (browser, Python). Arrows show OS bridging the gap.\n",

        "- **Analogy**: A juggler tossing multiple balls—each ball is a process, and the OS ensures none drop.\n",
        "- **Example**: Running a Python script for data analysis while streaming music.\n",
        "- **Math Insight**: Time-sharing uses “time slices” (e.g., 0.01 seconds per process). Equation: CPU Utilization = (Time on Processes) / (Total Time). High utilization (near 100%) means efficiency.\n",
