        "### 1.1 What is I/O in Operating Systems?\n",
        "**Input/Output (I/O)** is how computers interact with external devices, like reading/writing to a hard disk drive (HDD). Imagine a computer as a city:\n",
        "- **CPU**: The mayor, making fast decisions.\n",
        "- **RAM**: A quick-access town hall.\n",
        "- **Disk**: A distant warehouse, slow due to mechanical parts.\n",
        "\n",
        "HDDs store data on spinning platters in **tracks** (rings) and **sectors**. A read/write head moves mechanically, causing delays:\n",
        "- **Seek time**: Moving to the right track.\n",
        "- **Rotational latency**: Waiting for the sector to rotate under the head.\n",
        "- **Transfer time**: Reading/writing data.\n",
        "\n",
        "I/O is slow (milliseconds vs. CPU’s nanoseconds), like a snail vs. a jet. **I/O scheduling** optimizes the order of requests (e.g., “read track 50”) to minimize delays.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.2 Why Schedule I/O?\n",
        "**Goals**:\n",
        "- Minimize **total head movement** (tracks crossed).\n",
        "- Reduce **average response time** (request to completion).\n",
        "- Ensure **fairness** (avoid **starvation**).\n",
        "- Maximize **throughput** (requests per second).\n",
        "\n",
        "Poor scheduling causes **convoy effect** (short requests wait) or low throughput.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Analogy**: A librarian fetching books from shelves. Random fetching wastes steps; smart ordering saves time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Math**: Total seek time = Σ |current_track - next_track|. Average seek time = total / number_requests. Assume 1ms/track.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Case Study**: In CERN’s Large Hadron Collider, efficient I/O scheduling speeds up petabyte-scale data analysis, accelerating particle discoveries.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Visualization (Sketch)**:\n",
        "1. Draw a line (0-199 tracks).\n",
        "2. Mark head (e.g., 53) with a star, requests as dots (e.g., 20, 100).\n",
        "3. Arrows show head movements—shorter is better.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Exercise**: List three systems needing I/O scheduling (e.g., databases). Why does efficiency matter?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Research Insight**: Optimizing I/O is like streamlining experiments. How could this apply to simulating black holes?"
