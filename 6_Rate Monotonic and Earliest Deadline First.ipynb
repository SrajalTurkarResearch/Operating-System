    "# Real-Time Scheduling Tutorial: Rate Monotonic and Earliest Deadline First\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to this Jupyter Notebook tutorial on **Real-Time Scheduling**! As an aspiring scientist, you're diving into a critical field used in systems like spacecraft, medical devices, and autonomous vehicles, where timing is everything. This notebook is your one-stop resource to master **Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS)** and **Earliest Deadline First (EDF)**, covering:\n",
    "- **Theory**: Clear explanations with analogies.\n",
    "- **Practical Code**: Python simulations to see scheduling in action.\n",
    "- **Visualizations**: Timelines and utilization charts.\n",
    "- **Applications**: Real-world use cases.\n",
    "- **Research Directions**: Cutting-edge topics for your scientific career.\n",
    "- **Rare Insights**: Lesser-known nuances for deeper understanding.\n",
    "- **Mini-Project**: Simulate a basic real-time system.\n",
    "- **Major Project**: Design a complex system with fault tolerance.\n",
    "- **Additional Topics**: Concepts not covered in the previous tutorial, like aperiodic tasks, fault tolerance, and multiprocessor scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook assumes you're a beginner, so we'll start from scratch, use simple language, and include everything you need to become a researcher in real-time systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- Install Python and the following libraries:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  pip install numpy matplotlib\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Basic Python knowledge (loops, functions, lists).\n",
    "- No prior scheduling knowledge required!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Real-Time Scheduling?\n",
    "Real-time scheduling ensures tasks in a system meet strict timing deadlines. Imagine you're a chef in a kitchen (CPU) juggling dishes (tasks) that must be served on time (deadlines). Missing a deadline in a **hard real-time** system (e.g., an airbag deploying) is catastrophic, while in a **soft real-time** system (e.g., video streaming), it causes minor issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Terms**:\n",
    "- **Task**: A job with computation time (C) and period (T).\n",
    "- **Period (T)**: Time between task activations.\n",
    "- **Execution Time (C)**: Time to complete a task.\n",
    "- **Deadline**: When a task must finish (often equals period in RMS).\n",
    "- **Utilization (U)**: CPU usage, $ U = \\frac{C}{T} $.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "**RMS** is a static priority scheduling algorithm for periodic tasks in hard real-time systems. Tasks with shorter periods (higher frequency) get higher priority. It's like prioritizing customers who order food more frequently in a kitchen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works**:\n",
    "1. Assign priorities based on period (shorter period = higher priority).\n",
    "2. Preempt lower-priority tasks when a higher-priority task arrives.\n",
    "3. Priorities are fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Schedulability Test**:\n",
    "For $ n $ tasks, total utilization is:\n",
    "$$ U = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{C_i}{T_i} $$\n",
    "Tasks are schedulable if:\n",
    "$$ U \\leq n(2^{1/n} - 1) $$\n",
    "For example, for 3 tasks, $ U \\leq 0.78 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy**: A teacher grades frequent assignments first to give timely feedback.\n",

    "- **Tasks**: Defined as tuples (execution time, period, name).\n",
    "- **Utilization**: Checks if tasks are schedulable using the RMS bound.\n",
    "- **Simulation**: Tracks task releases and executes the highest-priority task (shortest period) at each time step.\n",
    "- **Visualization**: Shows a timeline where each task is color-coded.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "- **Avionics**: RMS is used in flight control systems (e.g., Boeing 787), prioritizing tasks like altitude checks over less frequent tasks like cabin updates. [Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/rate-monotonic-scheduling)\n",
    "- **Automotive**: Engine control units use RMS for periodic sensor checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rare Insights\n",
    "- **Data Dependencies**: RMS assumes no dependencies between tasks. If Task A must finish before Task B starts, RMS may waste CPU time unless dependencies are modeled. [Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/rate-monotonic-scheduling)\n",
    "- **Harmonic Periods**: If task periods are multiples of each other (e.g., 4, 8, 16), RMS can achieve higher utilization, sometimes up to 100%.\n",

    "**How It Works**:\n",
    "1. At each time step, pick the task with the earliest deadline.\n",
    "2. Preempt if a task with an earlier deadline arrives.\n",
    "3. Optimal for single processors (schedules any feasible task set).\n",

    "If $ U \\leq 1 $, tasks are schedulable.\n",

    "- **RMS Handling**: Use a **sporadic server** to allocate CPU time for aperiodic tasks without disrupting periodic ones.\n",
    "- **EDF Advantage**: Naturally handles aperiodic tasks by assigning priorities based on deadlines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fault Tolerance\n",
    "- **Need**: Real-time systems (e.g., satellites) must handle failures like missed deadlines or hardware faults.\n",
    "- **Techniques**:\n",
    "  - **Redundancy**: Run critical tasks on multiple processors.\n",
    "  - **Graceful Degradation**: Prioritize critical tasks in overload conditions.\n",
    "- **EDF Issue**: In overload, EDF may fail multiple tasks, requiring recovery mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiprocessor Scheduling\n",
    "- **Challenge**: RMS and EDF are designed for single processors. Multiprocessor systems require partitioning tasks or global scheduling.\n",
    "- **Approaches**:\n",
    "  - **Partitioned EDF**: Assign tasks to specific processors.\n",
    "  - **Global EDF**: Allow tasks to migrate across processors.\n",

    "### Context Switching Overheads\n",
    "- **Reality**: Switching tasks takes time (not assumed in basic RMS/EDF models).\n",
    "- **Impact**: Reduces effective CPU time, requiring adjusted schedulability tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Research Directions\n",
    "As a scientist, explore these areas:\n",
    "- **Mixed-Criticality Systems**: Schedule tasks with different criticality levels (e.g., safety-critical vs. non-critical).\n",
    "- **Energy-Aware Scheduling**: Optimize scheduling for low-power devices like IoT sensors.\n",
    "- **Machine Learning Integration**: Use ML to predict task arrivals and optimize EDF dynamically.\n",
    "- **Multiprocessor Real-Time**: Develop scalable algorithms for multi-core systems.\n",
    "- **Fault-Tolerant Scheduling**: Design systems that recover from missed deadlines or hardware failures.\n",

    "### Rare Insights\n",
    "- **RMS Harmonic Periods**: When task periods are harmonic (e.g., 5, 10, 20), RMS can achieve near-100% utilization, a fact often overlooked in basic analyses. [Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/rate-monotonic-scheduling)\n",
    "- **EDF Overload Behavior**: EDF’s domino effect in overload can be mitigated with techniques like **bandwidth reservation**.\n",
    "- **Context Switching**: Real systems incur overhead (0.1-1ms per switch), which must be factored into schedulability tests for accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "- **Medical Devices**: Pacemakers use RMS for periodic heart monitoring.\n",
    "- **IoT**: EDF schedules sensor data processing in smart cities.\n",
    "- **Space Exploration**: NASA’s Apollo missions used RMS for critical tasks. [Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/rate-monotonic-scheduling)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Next Steps for Scientists\n",
    "- **Experiment**: Extend the mini-project to include context-switching delays.\n",
    "- **Read**: Liu and Layland’s 1973 paper on RMS for foundational theory.\n",
    "- **Tools**: Use RTEMS or FreeRTOS to implement real-time scheduling.\n",
    "- **Publish**: Simulate a novel scheduling algorithm combining RMS and EDF for mixed-criticality systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Conclusion\n",
    "This notebook equips you with the theory, code, and projects to master RMS and EDF. You’ve learned how to simulate real-time systems, visualize schedules, and design fault-tolerant systems. As a scientist, use these skills to innovate in fields like robotics, aerospace, and IoT. Keep exploring, and you’re on your way to groundbreaking research!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Save this notebook regularly (Ctrl+S) to preserve your work. For the mini and major projects, experiment with different task sets and analyze their schedulability."
