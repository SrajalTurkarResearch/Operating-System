    "- **Theory**: I/O hardware includes devices for input (e.g., keyboards, sensors) and output (e.g., monitors, printers). The OS manages these to keep the CPU efficient, as devices are slow (~100 MB/s) compared to the CPU (~100 GB/s).\n",
    "- **Analogy**: The CPU is a chef, I/O devices are waiters (input) and delivery staff (output), and the OS is the restaurant manager.\n",
    "- **Real-World Example**: In bioinformatics, DNA sequencers input genetic data, and the OS outputs results to a database, speeding up drug discovery.\n",
    "- **Visualization**: Sketch this:\n",

    "- **Definition**: A device controller is a hardware chip managing an I/O device, translating its signals into OS-readable data.\n",
    "- **Logic**: Devices use unique signals (e.g., keyboard vs. printer). Controllers standardize these, using buffers to handle speed differences.\n",
    "- **Types**:\n",
    "  - Simple: Keyboard controller (key presses).\n",
    "  - Complex: Disk controller (read/write).\n",
    "- **How It Works**:\n",
    "  1. Device sends raw signals.\n",
    "  2. Controller converts to standard format.\n",
    "  3. Stores in buffer.\n",
    "  4. Sends to OS via ports or buses.\n",
    "- **Analogy**: Controller = translator at a global summit, converting device 'language' for the OS.\n",
    "- **Real-World Example**: In quantum computing, controllers process qubit data for analysis.\n",
    "- **Math**: Buffer size $B \\geq R_d \\times \\text{latency}$, where $R_d = 1\\ \\text{MB/s}$, latency = 1s, so $B \\geq 1\\ \\text{MB}$.\n",
